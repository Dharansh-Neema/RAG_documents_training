. 4\. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individuali zed basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disput es regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding Secti on 19.B.3 ("Waiver of Class and Other Non -Individualized Relief") including any claim that all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdicti on and not by an arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
